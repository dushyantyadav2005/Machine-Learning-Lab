# Machine-Learning-Lab

This repository contains clean, from-scratch implementations of core Machine Learning algorithms using only Python and NumPy. Each notebook or script focuses on building the algorithm logically and mathematically, without relying on high-level ML libraries. The goal is to provide a deep understanding of how each model works internally by deriving formulas, writing the code manually, and testing on small examples.

The repository covers essential preprocessing methods, evaluation metrics, linear and logistic models, Softmax regression, KNN, decision trees, AdaBoost, PCA, DBSCAN, optimization techniques like Momentum & Nesterov, and ensembling methods like Bagging and regularization (L1/L2). Each implementation is accompanied by clear explanations to help students and beginners understand both the intuition and the mathematics behind the algorithm.

This lab serves as a complete learning resource for anyone studying ML fundamentals, preparing for exams, or wanting to strengthen their conceptual base. Users can clone the repo, open the notebooks, and run each cell sequentially to see the full workflow—from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization. Contributions and improvements are welcome.
